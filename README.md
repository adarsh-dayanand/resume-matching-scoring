# resume-matching-scoring
The main objective of this project is to compare the given resume with application of job description in the company and give suitable result in terms of percentage and to score a resume and visualize it.

A company usually consists of its own job application formats. The
recruitment phase of a hiring process takes place when companies try to
reach a pool of candidates. Each job application has its own demand and
description with some key words. Our main aim is to find those key
words in the job description, and it needs to compare with resume given
by the job applicant. Python will be used for comparing those key words
of both resume and job description.
 Final result of this project will give you the total percentage of
match. That percentage will help the company HR team to recruit the
applicant. Our project helps in reducing the stress of the organization in
checking every single resume to meet its requirements.
